and have workflow order by this number

(medium) use md5 hash to check password, no plaintext


---done---

(high) when one participant leaves, remaining participant is routed to twiml:
say("the other participant has left the conference.  Thank you, good-bye.")
hangup()

(high) if no worker available, route caller to twilio:
say("sorry, all listeners are unavailable at this time.  Thank you, good-bye.")
then complete task

(high) when all time elapses, redirect both conference participants to twiml:
say("time's up.  Thank you, good-bye.")
hangup()
make sure that task has completed

(high) verify that add a new worker is functioning correctly

(high) match constraints from worker database table with Taskrouter worker list:
unique contact_uri

(high) validation error when worker insert fails should be more descriptive:
