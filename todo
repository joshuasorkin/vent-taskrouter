high: needed for first prototype release

(high) if some workers are not Offline, but they are busy with other tasks, the workflow should treat them
as unavailable

(high) how to move on to next queue after all workers in queue reject call?

(high) ability to create "do not connect" list for each user

(high) get app hosted on Heroku and verify sustained uptime

(high) document all configuration:
--toroid.org git hook
--server port listener setup
--local git configuration
--twilio configuration

(high) when worker answers, sometimes the beginning of the say() is cut off

(medium) include password for git push to server

(medium) server questions:
how do I add an alias?  can I write to .bashrc?

(medium) set up IVR to get time request
use task attribute to store time

(medium) fix error when it tries to complete an already completed task

(medium) on startup, assign random number property to each worker,
and have workflow order by this number

(medium) use md5 hash to check password, no plaintext

(low) check if caller is in list of users

---done---

(high) when one participant leaves, remaining participant is routed to twiml:
say("the other participant has left the conference.  Thank you, good-bye.")
hangup()

(high) if no worker available, route caller to twilio:
say("sorry, all listeners are unavailable at this time.  Thank you, good-bye.")
then complete task

(high) when all time elapses, redirect both conference participants to twiml:
say("time's up.  Thank you, good-bye.")
hangup()
make sure that task has completed

(high) verify that add a new worker is functioning correctly

(high) match constraints from worker database table with Taskrouter worker list:
unique contact_uri

(high) validation error when worker insert fails should be more descriptive:
"Worker with this contact_uri already exists" (since assumption is anyone inserting
worker is admin with correct password)

(high) worker.create needs to return correct value
